First, we need to make sure we have java
```
java -version
```
If you don't have java, installation is needed
```
sudo apt install default-jre
```
Install nextflow
```
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```
Export nextflow to $PATH
```
export PATH="[path_to_nextflow]":$PATH
```
Install miniconda per following instructions 
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html

Check conda on path.
